The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring

**Synopsis** 

A study was conducted at the University of Chicago comparing student learning under three separate conditions: conventional learning (i.e., control group), mastery learning, and tutoring.  Students participating in the study were assigned randomly to one of the three learning groups.  Each group was composed of students of similar aptitude and subject area interests.  The time for instruction was similar in each group.  The mastery learning and tutoring groups did have more time for assessment. 
In the conventional learning group, students would learn subject material in groups of 30 students per teacher with testing for evaluating student learning.  The test was used to determine the degree of student learning attained.  

In the mastery learning group, students would learn in groups of 30 per teacher under similar conditions to the conventional group.  They would be assessed with formative tests, same tests as the conventional group, with corrective feedback.  The feedback was followed by another formative assessment to measure student mastery on the subject material.
In the tutoring group, students would learn the subject material with a ratio of one tutor for one to three students.  If multiple students were placed in the group, the session would be held simultaneously.  Each tutoring session was followed by a formative test with corrective feedback, followed by another formative assessment.  The assessment regime was similar to the mastery learning group.  
In the completion of the study each group completed the same final achievement evaluation.  The differences in outcomes between the conventional learning group (i.e., control group), mastery learning, and tutoring was remarkable. It was found that the average student in the mastery learning group performed one standard deviation (i.e., sigma) above the average student in the conventional learning group.  Also, in the mastery learning group 70% of the students attained the same level of achievement reached by the highest 20% in the conventional group.  The average student in the mastery learning group was above 84% of the students in the conventional group.  It was found that the average student in the tutoring group performed two standard deviations above the average student in the conventional learning group.  The average student in the tutored group was above 98% of the students in the conventional group.  Also, in the tutoring group 90% of the students attained the same level of achievement reached by the highest 20% in the conventional group (Anaia, 1981 & Burke, 1983).

The study acknowledges that the tutoring model is extremely difficult to implement based on the cost, due to the number of teachers required for implementation.  It is possible to implement the mastery learning model and still attain the one sigma effect.  It is believed that the student gains for mastery learning, can be added to additional gains from different methods to create a combined model that yields a one sigma plus increase in overall student achievement (Leyton, 1983). Two additional studies were conducted focused on combining mastery learning with cognitive prerequisites (i.e., enhanced prerequisites) and cues, participation, and reinforcement.  
The enhanced prerequisites measured in the first study, were attained when a teacher performed a refresher of prior knowledge.  The refresher was performed during the first week of a new course.  This refresher in the study is referred to as enhanced prerequisites.  The enhanced prerequisites in the study yielded an additional 0.6 sigma.  The addition of enhanced learning and mastery learning netted a 1.6 sigma improvement in overall student achievement.  The average student in this enhanced learning and mastery learning group was above 95% of the students in the conventional group. It is noted that courses that occur in sequence should implement this approach with the second course and it should be conducted during the first week of classes (Leyton, 1983).

The second study called cues, participation, and reinforcement was also combined with the mastery learning.  It is noted that in this model students have enhanced participation and are actively engaged in learning.  The study found that students  participated 87% of the time compared with conventional learning groups.  The cues, participation, and reinforcement approach in the study yielded an addition 0.7 sigma.  The addition of cues, participation, and reinforcement and mastery learning netted a 1.7 sigma improvement in overall student achievement.  The average student in this cues, participation, and reinforcement and mastery learning group was above 96% of the students in the conventional group (Tenenbaum, 1982). 
There are numerous factors that can improve student learning, such as, reading skills, time on task, cooperative learning, homework that is graded, classroom morale, etc.  The studies performed focused on the best way to achieve results similar to tutoring in a cost-effective manner for a publicly funded school classroom.  The holistic approaches recommended in the article may be the optimal direction to take to achieve the best outcomes for student achievement based on funding constraints.  

**Connections & Conclusions**

How I intend to relate this new learning to my focus on assessment and evaluation would be to implement aspects of the enhanced learning, cues, participation, and reinforcement and mastery learning.  I think that assessing student’s prior knowledge and implementing enhanced learning during the first week of a new course would be beneficial.  Also, another example of an implementation could be in the creation a computer program.  Firstly, using UML in the design phase, execute the code during production and study the errors during execution.  This example models cues, participation, and reinforcement.  Using a platform like replit.com can also reduce the obstacles that students may encounter while setting up and running a code editor or IDE.   Also, during the instruction of daily lessons, white boards, questioning, and other technology products such as kahoot or quizlet can be used for cueing.  For reinforcement activities such as exit cards, polls, formative assessments can also be used.
